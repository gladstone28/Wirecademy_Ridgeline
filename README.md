# INTRODUCTION TO UI AND UX DESIGN

## Wirecademy: Ridgeline

It’s your first day on the job as a user interface designer working at an up-and-coming design firm. In your kick-off meeting, your supervisor assigns you to your first project. You are asked to create two unique wireframe sketches that serve as possible solutions for the product detail page of Ridgeline, a popular outdoor clothing company.

The product detail page you are tasked with creating wireframes for is a colorful, water-resistant, insulated jacket that is constructed with eco-friendly and recycled materials. Your supervisor encourages pen and paper sketching but is flexible as to what tools you use to complete the project. Whiteboard and marker, tablet, digital design software, or other sketching methods are appropriate.

Prior to your start date, comprehensive user research was conducted which will allow you to create sketches that meet the product requirements: user needs, stakeholder goals, and technical capabilities. User research concludes that, at a minimum, users want the following information on the product page of a website:

1. Navigation bar
2. Product name
3. Product cost
4. Product description
5. Available colors
6. Available sizes
7. Visual element of the product
8. “Add to Cart” button

Some users also expressed interest in additional features that assist in the purchase of a product. This includes:

9. Product reviews
10. Size chart
11. Shipping options
12. “Add to Wishlist” button

With this information, you can strategically create wireframe sketches comprised of wireframe elements that serve as possible solutions to the project requirements. When you begin sketching, keep in mind the approximate size and location of elements within the confines of the wireframe sketch.

This project contains a series of open-ended requirements. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Let’s dive in!


## Getting Started


To kick things off, you are provided a template that you can use to help get started.

In the wireframe project template, you will find a collection of common wireframe elements that can be used as a reference when creating your sketches. You can use these elements as you see fit, but you are not limited to using only the elements provided. Additionally, we have provided two frames for you to create sketches within. Size elements appropriately and according to the hierarchy of importance within the confines of the frame. Annotate your sketches when appropriate.

If you have access to a printer, you can print the starting template and then sketch directly onto the paper. You are also able to download the template, upload it to a digital design tool of your choice, then sketch within the digital tool. If you have any loose paper nearby, that will work as an excellent canvas to sketch on if you don’t have access to a printer.

If additional space is needed for more iterations, you can continue sketching on the backside of the template, print another template document, or utilize any paper that might be nearby.
